Disaster, we've heard from Steve Johnson's lawyers.
He claims that Michael Mitchell was hired on the same day as him, but was hired later in the day. Mitchell 
should have been let go, not him.
Confirm this by extending the number of results and make sure nobody else was hired on that day.
Then modify the query to return the correct 3 people.
Continue to use HireDate as the primary sort column, but use EmployeeId as the tie breaker.
Assume that a higher EmployeeId means they were hired later.


My solution:

select concat(FirstName, " ", LastName) as Name, EmployeeId, HireDate from Employee
order by HireDate desc, EmployeeId desc
limit 3;


Their solution:
SELECT EmployeeId, LastName, FirstName, HireDate FROM Employee
ORDER BY HireDate DESC, EmployeeId DESC
LIMIT 3;
