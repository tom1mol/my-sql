Which Media Type is most popular? How could you answer this with a single query? 
You probably cannot based on what you know so far. We will get there.
For now, you can use a separate query for each media type so see how many tracks use it. Expected : MPEG audio file


select MediaType.MediaTypeId as MediaType, count(Name) from MediaType;

select Employee.FirstName as Employee, count(Customer.FirstName) as Customer from Employee
join Customer on Customer.SupportRepId = Employee.EmployeeId
where Employee.FirstName = "Jane";

select Track.MediaTypeId as Track, count(MediaTypeId) from Track;

select count(*) from MediaType 
where Name  = "MPEG audio file";
