/*
Join the 'Track' table and the 'MediaType' table to create a query that shows the Name of the Track,
and the Name of the Media Type. Both tables have a 'MediaTypeId' column that you can join on.

Select every track name and the track's associated media type
*/

solution:

SELECT Track.Name, MediaType.Name FROM Track 
INNER JOIN MediaType on Track.MediaTypeId = MediaType.MediaTypeId;
